## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning models to analyze and predict stock prices for various companies. The focus is on creating robust pipelines for data fetching, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The project includes multiple approaches, such as LSTM, Linear Regression, and Random Forest models, to assess prediction accuracy and efficiency.

## Background
The stock market is inherently volatile, and predicting stock prices has always been a challenge. This project aims to bridge the gap between data-driven insights and actionable predictions by leveraging machine learning. By exploring multiple algorithms and data features, this project seeks to:

1. Provide investors with tools to better anticipate stock price movements.

2. Showcase the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches, including time-series models like LSTM and traditional models like Random Forest and Linear Regression.

3. Highlight trends and anomalies in historical stock data that can inform investment decisions.


The selected companies include industry leaders, ensuring diverse representation and meaningful insights across sectors. The project is designed to evolve into a robust prediction tool, offering scalability and adaptability for new data and models.

## Questions We Hope to Answer:

1. How accurately can stock prices be predicted using different machine learning models?

2. What are the key features that influence stock price predictions?

3. How do models like LSTM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression compare in performance for stock price forecasting?

4. Can engineered features such as moving averages and volatility improve prediction accuracy?

5. What trends or anomalies can be observed in historical stock data for specific companies?

6. What are the residual patterns and how can they inform improvements in model performance?

7. How does the prediction accuracy vary for different stock tickers and industries?

## Approach
To address these questions, the project follows a structured methodology, combining data collection, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation:

1. Data Collection

Source: 

• Historical stock price data is fetched from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
Scope: 

• The dataset includes features like adjusted closing prices, volume, and market indicators for selected companies.
Storage: 

• Data is stored in an SQLite database for ease of access and future processing.

2. Data Preprocessing

Cleaning: 

• Handles missing values and filters out inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: 

• Constructs new features such as moving averages (7-day, 14-day), volatility, and lagged values.

Normalization: 

• Scales features using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler to prepare data for model input.

3. Model Training

LSTM Models:

• Trains long short-term memory (LSTM) models for time-series predictions.

• Leverages sequential data to capture trends and patterns over time.

Linear Regression Models:

• Implements traditional linear regression for baseline comparisons.

• Trains models on engineered features to assess their contribution.

Random Forest Models:

• Utilizes ensemble learning to improve prediction stability and accuracy.

• Captures non-linear relationships in the dataset.

4. Model Evaluation

Metrics:

• Mean Squared Error (MSE):

	 • Definition: 

	   Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

	 • Significance:

	   • Penalizes larger errors more heavily, making it useful for identifying models that struggle with significant deviations.

	   • Lower MSE indicates better predictive accuracy.

	 • Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):

	  • Definition: 

	   • The square root of the Mean Squared Error, providing an error measure in the same units as the target variable.

	  • Significance:

	   • More interpretable than MSE because it is expressed in the same units as stock prices.

	   • Lower RMSE reflects higher accuracy and minimal large errors.

	• Mean Absolute Error (MAE):

	 • Definition: 

	  • The average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.

	 • Significance:

	  •Provides a linear scale of errors, giving equal weight to all deviations regardless of their magnitude.

	  •Lower MAE indicates the model’s ability to provide consistent predictions close to the actual values.

	• R² (Coefficient of Determination):

	 • Definition: 

	  • Represents the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model.

	 •Significance:

	  •Values range from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate better model fit.

	  •A value close to 1 implies that the model explains a significant portion of the variability in stock prices.
	Visualizations:

	• Actual vs. Predicted stock prices.

	• Residual distributions and scatter plots.

	Comparison:

	• Evaluates and compares models to identify strengths and weaknesses.

5. Iterative Refinement

	• Incorporates findings from evaluations to refine feature engineering and hyperparameters for improved performance.

	• Saves trained models and scalers for deployment or further testing.
