## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning models to analyze and predict stock prices for various companies...

## Background
The stock market is inherently volatile, and predicting stock prices has always been a challenge...

## Approach
To address these questions, the project follows a structured methodology, combining data collection, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation...

## Data Exploration Phase
### Data Retrieval
Sources:
• Historical stock price data is retrieved from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance Python library...

## Analysis Phase
### Machine Learning Models
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
Purpose:
• Time-series model designed to capture sequential dependencies in stock price movements...

## Technologies
Programming Languages
• Python: Primary language for data analysis, machine learning, and automation...
