# Machine Learning Project: Oil and Telecom Sector Stock Analysis

## Overview

This project is designed to showcase the application of a linear regression machine learning model to predict future stock market prices for three prominent companies in each of the oil and telecom sectors: Exxon, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron (Oil), as well as Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T (Telecom).

## Ethical Considerations
Ethical concerns were considered throughout the project development process:
1. Accuracy of Data: The data used for analysis was sourced from verified APIs (Yahoo Finance API via yfinance library). Care was taken to ensure that the data was not manipulated beyond typical cleaning steps, such as filling missing values or removing duplicates.
2. Privacy: The project does not use any personal or private data. All stock market data is publicly available through APIs and is used solely for educational and analysis purposes.
3. Financial Responsibility: The visualizations and analyses provided are meant for educational purposes and do not constitute financial advice. The data is historical, and stock performance should not be taken as an indicator of future results. Users should exercise caution and perform their own research before making any investment decisions.
## Data Sources
* Yahoo Finance API via the yfinance Python library: All stock data for the oil and telecom companies is fetched using this API.
